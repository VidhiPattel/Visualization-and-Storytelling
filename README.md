# Visualization and Storytelling Portfolio
Welcome to my Data Visualization and Storytelling Portfolio! Here I am going to share the visualization works that I have prepared during the Fall semester. 

## About Me

Hi! I'm Vidhi Patel, a Master's student in Business Analytics and AI program at Ontario Tech University, passionate about turning data into actionable insights through the power of visualization and storytelling.
