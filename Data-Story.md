# Data Story

## Introduction
This data story, created using **Canvas** and **Flourish**, explores Durham Region's greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and the urgent need to address its climate challenges. Using data from Durham’s Open Data Portal, the project identifies major emission hotspots, key contributing sectors such as hospitals and treatment plants, and the region’s shortfall in meeting its 2030 climate targets. By presenting interactive visuals and actionable insights, this story highlights the critical need for renewable energy adoption and targeted emission reductions to safeguard the health, environment, and future of Durham’s communities.

## Iteration 1
In the first iteration, the project began by focusing on global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions before pivoting to a localized analysis of Durham Region's GHG emissions. This shift allowed for a more specific and actionable narrative. The process involved selecting a blue-based color palette to convey a sense of trust and environmental focus, paired with the Aileron font for readability and modernity. Sequencing inspiration was drawn from Mona Chalabi’s visual storytelling style, ensuring a logical and impactful flow of information. Key charts, such as Sankey diagrams, slope graphs, projections, and matrix diagrams, were chosen to represent complex data effectively. This initial phase laid the foundation for further refinements and iterations while emphasizing the significance of local climate actions.

## Iteration 2
In iteration 2, the focus shifted toward refining the data visualizations to enhance clarity and engagement. Building on the feedback from the first iteration, the team worked to improve the representation of Durham Region's greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions data. The visualizations now included a more structured matrix layout to detail GHG contributions across different cities and sectors within the region. The Sankey diagram was refined to better illustrate the flow of emissions sources and their impacts. Additionally, the color scheme and design elements were updated to improve readability and align with the thematic emphasis on climate change and sustainability. This iteration ensured that the data story was not only informative but also visually cohesive, paving the way for further improvements in subsequent iterations.

## Iteration 3
Building on the foundational work of iterations 1 and 2, the third iteration further optimized the narrative and visuals for greater impact and clarity. The focus was on aligning the message with actionable insights for Durham Region's greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reductions. Key enhancements included the addition of comparative city-specific data, emphasizing the significant contributions of Oshawa, Whitby, Ajax, and Pickering, while incorporating projected temperature increases and their socioeconomic consequences. To maintain a cohesive design, the blue-based color palette and Aileron font were preserved, with minor tweaks for accessibility. New visual elements, such as dynamic matrix overlays and streamlined slope graphs, were introduced to highlight emission trends and the region’s deviation from climate targets. This iteration underscored the urgency of local actions, linking them directly to Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and ensuring the narrative flow remained both engaging and educational.
