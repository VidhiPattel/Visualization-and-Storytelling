# Peer Profile

## Introduction 
This activity is a peer profile exercise where students interact with their classmates to gather insights about lifestyle changes before, during, and after the COVID-19 pandemic. The questions were designed to explore topics such as health consciousness, screen time distribution, fast-food consumption, and leisure time. Responses were recorded and visualized through graphs and tables to depict trends and differences across these time periods. The aim was to analyze behavioral changes due to the pandemic and understand its long-lasting effects on daily life.

## Final Output
From the visual data representations, it is evident that the COVID-19 pandemic brought significant changes in people's lifestyles. Health consciousness seems to have increased post-COVID, highlighting an emphasis on well-being. Screen time allocation shifted towards entertainment and social media during the pandemic, while work demands remained relatively consistent. Fast-food consumption decreased during the pandemic, possibly due to lockdowns, and gradually increased post-COVID. Leisure time peaked during the pandemic but normalized afterward. This activity emphasizes how individuals adapt their habits in response to major global events and the importance of flexibility in lifestyle choices.
