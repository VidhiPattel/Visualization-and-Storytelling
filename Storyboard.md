# Storyboard

## Introduction
For this assignment, we were tasked to focus on a human-centered data story. I have chosen this topic as climatic migration is an increasingly pressing issue as 
rising sea levels and frequent flooding force hundreds of thousands of people to leave their homes. This narrative focuses on the impact of rising sea levels and 
flooding on human displacement, with a narrative centered around a young boy named Jacob, whose life is dramatically altered by these environmental changes. Through 
Jacob's story, we explore the broader consequences of climate-induced migration, including the loss of homes, livelihoods, and communities, while emphasizing the 
scale of this issue worldwide.

## Iterations and Final Storyboard
In developing my data story on climatic migration and sea-level rise, I began with brainstorming using **Miro**, organizing ideas with colorful sticky notes to represent elements like topics, characters, data, and impacts. Inspired by research on how rising sea levels displace communities, I decided to tell the story through the experiences of affected individuals. I sketched rough ideas to visualize how lives are disruptedâ€”people leaving everything behind, losing loved ones, and cities at risk of sinking. In the third iteration, I created a storyboard in PowerPoint, incorporating data charts, impactful images, and meaningful color gradients (e.g., gloomy greys and red-to-white gradients) to emphasize the topic's urgency. The story progresses from current impacts to potential future consequences, aiming to make the data come alive and connect with the audience emotionally.
